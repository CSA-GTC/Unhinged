# Unhinged
Work in progress

This game is a top down endless runner themed on Mars

At the moment there are many known issues such as:
    * No path collison
    * The player model does not turn

In addition to these problems, things to add in the future are:
    * Enemies
    * Points/Time survived
    * Sound

Thank you for playing and please note any other issues you find
